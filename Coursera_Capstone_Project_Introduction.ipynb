    "#### AmerCave Group is a business entity who has spread its wings across the US. It has a chain of shopping malls and restaurants in almost all major cities of different states in America. As part of expanding business, they are  strategically stepping outside US. AmerCave have chosen East Asia and Middle East for deploying their first shopping mall and an American restaurant.  The reason for selecting both are given below.\n",
    "#### a.\tEast Asia and Middle East are fast growing economies, both having outstanding and competitive regional hubs for starting a business. Middle East, especially Dubai, UAE is an extremely attractive business destination and a great tourism spot. Lot of investments pouring in for the oil sector makes Dubai an advantage for investors. Apart from that, it is the gateway for Eastern markets as it acts as a hub for imports and exports. The city attracts a lot of expat investors as well.\n",
    "#### b.\tKuala Lumpur, Malaysia in the East Asian region have an increasing consumer demand from various nearby countries like India, China etc. It is set to be the center of digital economy and have a multitude of business forms. A diversified workforce is another advantage for opening a business in Malaysia. Kuala Lumpur offers a competitive market as well.\n"
